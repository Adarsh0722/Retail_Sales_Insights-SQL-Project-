## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using **SQL (PostgreSQL)**.  
It covers data cleaning, exploration, and solving key business problems to extract meaningful insights from transactional data.
The dataset captures retail transactions including date, time, customer demographics, product categories, and sales values.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Table Creation**
   - Defined schema for `retail_sales` with attributes such as transaction ID, customer details, category, and sales metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Identified and removed rows with missing/NULL values to ensure data consistency.

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Basic insights like total sales, unique customers, product categories, and customer age ranges.

4. **Business Analysis**
   - Solved real-world business questions using SQL queries:
     - Sales on a specific date (`2022-11-05`).
     - High-quantity Clothing sales in November 2022.
     - Total sales per category.
     - Average age of Beauty category customers.
     - Transactions above 1000 in value.
     - Gender-wise sales distribution per category.
